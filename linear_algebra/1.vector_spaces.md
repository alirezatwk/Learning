# Vector Spaces
Definition: A **vector space** (or **linear space**) $V$ over a field $F$ consist of a set on which two operations (called **addition** and **scalar multiplication**, respectively) are defined so that for each pair of elements $x, y \in V$ there is a unique element $x+y\in V$, and for each element $a \in F$ and $x \in V$, there is a unique element $ax \in V$ s.t.

1. $x + y = y + x$              (commutativity of addition)
2. $(x + y) + z = x + (y + z)$  (associativity of addition)
3. $\exists\;0\in V$ s.t. $\forall_{x\in V}\;x + 0 = x$
4. $\forall_{x\in V}\;\exists_{y\in V}\;\;x + y = 0$
5. $\forall_{x\in V}\; 1x=x$
6. $(ab)x = a(bx)$
7. $a(x + y) = ax + ay$
8. $(a+b)x = ax + bx$

Additional properties that we can derive:
- $0$ is unique
- $y$ in 4 is unique
- $0x = 0$
- $a0 = 0$

**Scalars** := elements in $F$\
**Vectors** := elements in $V$

# Subspaces
Definition: A subset $W$ of a vector space $V$ over a field $F$ is called a **subspace** of $V$ if $W$ is a vector space over $F$ with the operations of addition and scalar multiplication defined on $V$.

Subset $W$ of a vector space $V$ is a subspace of $V$ if and only if the following four properties hold:
1. $x+y\in W$ if $x, y\in W$ (close under addition)
2. $cx \in W$ if $c \in F$ and $x \in W$  (close under multiplication)
3. has a zero vector
4. has additive inverse $x + (-x) = 0$

Theorem: Any intersection of subspaces of a vector space $V$ is a subspace of $V$.

**Direct sum** definition: A vector space $V$ is called the direct sum of $W_1$ and $W_2$ if both are subspaces of $V$ s.t. $W_1 \cap W_2 = \{0\}$ and $W_1 + W_2 = V$.
